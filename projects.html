        Modular algorithms are a staple method for producing fast algorithms in
        computer algebra. Usually, we think about modular algorithms as a tool
        that only makes sense to use over the integers/rationals. For my
        research project, I investigated extending modular algorithms to perform
        fast computation over quadratic algebraic number fields, with some
        success! See the example of a modular linear solver for something really
        cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since completing this project, I found out that the Magma computer
        algebra system uses a similar (modular) method to solve linear systems
        over quadratic algebraic number fields! I think it's pretty cool that I
        accidentally ended up stumbling upon the same thing that some really
        smart people had already discovered.

<section class="accordion" id="magma_integration_project"> Symbolic Integration in Magma </section>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Source code: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellholt/magma-integration">[GitHub repository] </a></p>
    <p> Introduction to mathematical concepts: <a href="files/intro-to-symbolic-integration.pdf" download> [pdf] </a></p>
    <p> Documentation and report: <a href="files/magma-report.pdf" download> [pdf] </a></p>
    <p>
        Magma does not have a symbolic computation library! This project is a
        partial implementation of the Risch integration procedure that aims to
        integrate nicely with the existing differential algebra functionality of
        Magma. You'll notice that I only have implementations for the
        integration of rational and logarithmic functions, and my logarithmic
        integration code unfortunately does not pass my tests.

<div class="accordion"> <em> VERY FAST </em> FFT Polynomial Multiplication </div>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Source code: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellholt/COSC3500-project/tree/main/Parallel">[GitHub repository] </a></p>
    <p> Overview of optimisations: <a href="https://youtu.be/3CRFYLBX31g">[YouTube Video] </a> </p>
    <p>
        This was a really fun project I did for my High Performance Computing
        class (COSC3500) at the University of Queensland! I spent way too long
        writing some <em>very fast</em> C code for the multiplication of
        polynomials whose coefficients come from a specific finite field. The
        final result is that I am more than 5 times faster than Maple! (with the
        caveat that Maple, unlike me, has to interpret source code and decide
        which kernel code to execute at runtime)

<section class="accordion"> Dracula's Spooky Castle </section>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Source code: <a href="https://github.com/alegs-a/bears-ink">[GitHub repository] </a></p>
    <p>
        This is a pretty cool project I made in a small team for my computer
        science capstone project! <em> Dracula's Spooky Castle </em> is a hidden
        information game where players race to track down and throw a lethal
        volume of holy water on Dracula before they are (rather gruesomely)
        eliminated by Dracula! On each turn, players can move to a new room on a
        castle board, cast light to block Dracula, and throw holy water to
        attack him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our project is a "technology-enhanced board game" that aims to integrate
        cool computer stuff into the already very cool traditional board game
        medium. Some of the more unfortunate members of the team wrote all of
        the hardware stuff (interacting with RFID readers on the board, writing
        to a display, etc.) while I got to have a blast writing an AI to play as
        Dracula. Let me know if you can beat it! (I can't, even though I know
        how it makes all of it's decisions)
    </p>
    <p>
        There might be a web version of the game coming to my website soon...
