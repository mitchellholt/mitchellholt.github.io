<section class="accordion"> Modular Algorithms for Computation in Quadratic Algebraic Number Fields </section>

    <p>
        I gave this talk on my AMSI summer research scholarship project at
        AMSIConnect 2025. The audience was a group of mathemeticians, some of
        whom may not have much experience with algebra. The goal of my talk was
        to get them to understand the context of computer algebra and a little
        bit of the motivation for generalising modular algorithms. You can read
        a little more about my project
        <a href="projects.html#modular_algorithms_project">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the best talk I've ever given - I've never put so little in the
        slides before! It's a shame it wasn't recorded.

<section class="accordion"> What Even is a Computer Algebra? </section>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CTj36qzWcPI?si=j-ZYv3EZCvivCtdZ"> [YouTube video] </a>
    <p> Slides: <a href="files/ComputerAlgebraIntro-UQCS.pdf" download> [pdf] </a> </p>
    <p>
        This is a talk I gave to the <a href="https://uqcs.org/">
        UQ Computing Society, </a> aiming to introduce students with a
        background in programming to doing <em>exact</em> mathematical
        computation, and the broader field of computer algebra. I found out
        later that one of the students who attended the talk went away and
        spoke to a professor at UQ about doing an honours project in computer
        algebra - and that they were inspired to do so by my talk!

        Please note that it was very cool at the time to slap AI generated
        images of bears everywhere. I promise I'm not crazy.

<section class="accordion"> Symbolic Integration in Computer Algebra </section>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Slides: <a href="files/IntegrationTalk-MSS.pdf" download> [pdf] </a> </p>
    <p>
        This was a really fun talk I gave to the <a href="https://uqmss.org/">
        UQ Mathematics Student Society </a> in early 2024. I wish there was a
        recording because this was a great time, and I got to answer some really
        interesting and thoughtful questions!

<section class="accordion"> Algorithmic Symbolic Integration -- An Introduction </section>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Recording: <a href="https://youtu.be/G1QPvkgrBfk?si=YTn2ZzzLWfZwmbAZ"> [YouTube video] </a> </p>

    <p>
        A talk I gave in January 2024 after a project where I learned about the
        Risch algorithm for symbolic integration, which you can read more about
        <a href="projects.html#magma_integration_project">here.</a> In this
        talk, I cover the very basics of the integration of rational functions,
        and I show off a (preliminary) version of my integration library!
